I'm working on a project to create an API for accessing and calculating information related to the Gene Ontology. I'm currently using the CherryPy framework and a python codebase. The GOServer.py file contains the minimal cherrypy code to expose a few API endpoints (index, gene, term, allTerms, etc). When started, the GOServer creates an instance of the Ontology class described in Ontology.py. The Ontology class describes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of terms from the Gene Ontology (GO). Each GO term is an instance of the OntoTerm class created in OntoTerm.py. Each OntoTerm contains information in fields about its unique identifier (uid), name, defintion or description (defn). The parent-child relationships of the DAG structure are created through lists of references to parent OntoTerms in each child OntoTerm. There are three types of relationship: the is_a, part_of, and regulates fields are each sets of references to parent OntoTerms. Within the Ontology class, the terms field is a dictionary mapping from an OntoTerm's unique id (uid) to the OntoTerm itself; the roots field is a list of all OntoTerms that have no parents (there are typically 3 when working with GO). All of this information is derived from a file called go.obo, which is very large, and is parsed by the loadOboFile method of the Ontology class constructor. After the parent relationships are parsed from the input file, each OntoTerm also calculates a .children field which is a set of references to all child OntoTerms.

After the structure of the GO DAG hierarchy is loaded, then the annotations of individual genes to each GO term are loaded from a file specific to a certain species. One example of these files is in gene_association.sgd, which is also a very large file. This file is parsed by the loadAnnoFile method of the Ontology class. During that parsing, the identity of all genes is determined and instances of the Gene class from Gene.py are ceated. Each Gene instance has a field for its unique identifier (uid), official symbol (symbol), commonly used name (name), and a set of aliases for that gene (aliases). (As a quick aside: biology has poorly named genes causing name changes over time and even name re-use to refer to different DNA locations.)  As the annotation file is parsed, each line associates a Gene with an OntoTerm based on a particular evidence code (a short string). These are considered "direct annotations" and they are stored in the .direct field of the Gene class and the .direct field of the OntoTerm class. In both cases, the .direct field is a dictionary whose keys are the evidence codes and whose values are sets of references to the other class. While the input file only contains these "direct annotaations" - these are implicity passed upward through the DAG structure, so a direct annotation to one GO term is also an indirect annotation to all of its parent GO terms, and their parents, and theirs, and so on all the way to a root GO term. The set of all annotations (both direct and indirect) are contained within .annos fields of the Gene and OntoTerm classes, and they are created by recursively traversing up the DAG structure during parsing.

With all of that loaded into the Ontology instance called go in the GOServer, this class then uses the cherrypy syntax to return JSON of information about genes and GO terms. Does this structure make sense for you? I'd like some help expanding and cleaning up some of this functionality, particularly to include several statistical tests, and in creating particular JSON structures suitable for visualization by a separate code base.
